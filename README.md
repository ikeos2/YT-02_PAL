# YT-02_PAL
Pal was a school project where we worked as a team to create a mobile app and a backend server driven by Spring framework.
=================================================================
Meet Pal, a “super app” specifically tailored to meet the needs of college students. First and foremost, Pal is an organization tool, with integrated note-taking, task management, and a highly customizable notification system all at your fingertips.. It allows students to manage various aspects of their daily lives and takes advantage of the following features:

Modularity
Our application will take into account modern practices of modular design, so as to allow future developers to implement new ideas without disturbing the current implementation. This will also open up the possibility for third-parties to extend the available functionalities.

Module ideas:
-Full spectrum note taking
-Task manager with properly designed Android notification system
-Course manager
   +Allow teachers to post content
   +Students can then add all of their courses
-Advanced geo-tracking to monitor a student’s daily progress, providing them with real-time updates based on their daily task list. The student will also be able to monitor where they traveled throughout the course of a day.

User Types and Permissions
Each module will have it’s own set of permissions, based on whether a user is a student, faculty member, or administrator.


Servers and the Clients
Pal will utilize a server client relation for certain aspects of each module. This will allow modules to push and pull data as needed from a central location. For the scope of this class a single server will be used, but if additional complexity is required multiple server functionality can be designed and implemented.
